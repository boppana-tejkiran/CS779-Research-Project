# Project Description

This project was done in the course CS779 Statistical-NLP at the IITK. This research project was assigned in a team of five people, where we first needed to do a survey of the preferred area, and then implement some idea, based on the survey.

Our team was assigned the topic: "Transfer Learning and Model Agnostic Meta Learning". The details of the team members is as follow:

| Name      | Email |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Shivam Aggarwal | shivama20@iitk.ac.in |
| Aman singh      | amansingh20@iitk.ac.in       |
| Aman Aryan  | ryn20@iitk.ac.in        |
| Boppana Tej Kiran | tejkiranb20@iitk.ac.in |
| Krishna Mohan | kmohan20@iitk.ac.in |

As the first part of the project, we conducted a vast literature survey of the area, and prepared a survey paper based on that. This paper is present in the repository as Survey_Paper.pdf

During the Literature survey, we found out that not much work has been done on the Native Indian languages, in MAML.
So we decided to implement the NLI task for Indian languages using the MAML. The project report is present as the 'Project_Report.pdf' and the implementation of the project is present inside the 'project' directory.
