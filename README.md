# Project Description

This project was done in the course CS779 Statistical-NLP at the IITK. This research project was assigned in a team of five people, where we first needed to do a survey of the preferred area, and then implement some idea, based on the survey.

Our team was assigned the topic: "Transfer Learning(TL) and Model Agnostic Meta Learning(MAML)". The details of the team members is as follow:

| Name      | Email |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Shivam Aggarwal | shivama20@iitk.ac.in |
| Aman singh      | amansingh20@iitk.ac.in       |
| Aman Aryan  | ryn20@iitk.ac.in        |
| Boppana Tej Kiran | tejkiranb20@iitk.ac.in |
| Krishna Mohan | kmohan20@iitk.ac.in |

As the first part of the project, we conducted a vast literature survey on the topic "Transfer Learning and Model Agnostic Meta Learning", and prepared a survey paper based on that. This paper is present in the repository as Survey_Paper.pdf

During the Literature survey, we found out that not much work has been done on the Native Indian languages, in MAML.
So we decided to implement a Natural Language Inference task of  textual entailment for Indian languages using the MAML. The project report is present as the 'Project_Report.pdf' and the implementation of the project is present inside the 'project' directory.
